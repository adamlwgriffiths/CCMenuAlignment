CCMenu+Alignment
=====================

Adds left / right alignment methods to CCMenu (and also CCMenuAdvanced).


Features
-------------

   * Decorates CCMenu and CCMenuAdvanced with new functions.
   * Provide left and right alignment of menu or its items.
   * Provides vertical alignment relative to menus position instead of existing 'expand in all directions' behavior.
   * Does not interfere with existing alignment functions.


Usage
-----------------------

Simply drop the source files in your project and include the .h file.

Once you've vertically aligned your menu how you want, simply call [menu leftAlignItems] or [menu rightAlignItems] and
the menu items will be left or right aligned along the menu's X position.

Dependencies
----------------------------

   * cocos2d-iphone (or Kobold2d)
   * CCMenuAdvanced (optional)
